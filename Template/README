Purpose:
- Phase1: Create MapperInput directory; Traverse through directory tree; Add file paths to Mapper_m.txt file where m is the file number. m should not exceed the #mappers value the
user passed in.
- Phase2: Creates m number of pipes; Spawns mapper processe; Opens each filepath from MapperInput; Find the number of words for each letter
Sned information to the reducer process with a pipe from each mapper.
- Phase3: Receives lists from mapper and combines it into a single list; write this list to ReducerREsult.txt
- Phase4: Take ReducerResult.txt and direct it to standard output. Standard output should be redirected to FinalResult.txt

What it does:
- Calculates the number of words corresponding to each letter using mapreduce

Compilation:
./mapreduce folderName #mappers
